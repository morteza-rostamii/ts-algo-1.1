<!-- 
Beginner Level:
Sum of Elements: Calculate the sum of all elements in an array.

Maximum Element: Find the maximum element in an array.

Minimum Element: Determine the minimum element in an array.

Array Reversal: Reverse the elements of an array in-place.

Array Rotation: Rotate the elements of an array left or right by a specified number of positions.

Duplicate Removal: Remove duplicates from an array while preserving the order of elements.

Array Sorting: Implement a simple sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort) to sort an array in ascending order.

Finding the Second Largest Element: Find the second largest element in an array.

Finding Pairs with a Given Sum: Find all pairs of elements in an array that sum up to a given target value.

Frequency of Elements: Count the frequency of each element in an array and return a dictionary with elements as keys and frequencies as values.

Intermediate Level:
Intersection of Two Arrays: Find the intersection of two arrays, i.e., elements that appear in both arrays.

Union of Two Arrays: Compute the union of two arrays, i.e., elements that appear in either array.

Largest Continuous Subarray Sum: Find the subarray with the largest sum within a given array (Kadane's algorithm).

Majority Element: Determine the majority element (appearing more than n/2 times) in an array.

Product of Array Except Self: Calculate the product of every element except the current element in an array.

Leaders in an Array: Find all the leaders in an array. An element is called a leader if there are no elements greater than it to its right.

Stock Buy and Sell: Determine the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks at the correct times given an array of stock prices.

Find Missing Number: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing.

Merge Sorted Arrays: Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

Smallest Missing Positive Integer: Find the smallest missing positive integer in an array.

Advanced Level:
Longest Increasing Subsequence: Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.

Next Permutation: Implement the next lexicographically greater permutation of numbers in an array.

Trapping Rain Water: Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map, calculate how much water it can trap after raining.

Maximum Product Subarray: Find the contiguous subarray within an array that has the largest product of its elements.

Kth Smallest Element in an Array: Find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array.

Minimum Size Subarray Sum: Find the minimum size subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to a given target.

Valid Mountain Array: Determine if an array can form a valid mountain pattern.

First Missing Positive: Find the first missing positive integer in an unsorted array.

Remove Duplicates in Place: Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

Product of Three Numbers: Find the maximum product of three numbers in an array.

These challenges span different difficulty levels and cover various aspects of array manipulation, algorithms, and problem-solving skills using 1D arrays in Python. They're designed to progressively challenge your skills as you move from beginner to intermediate and advanced levels.
